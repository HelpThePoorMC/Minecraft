<h2>
What is Minecraft?
</h2>
<h3>
Fundementals
</h3>
<p>
Minecraft is a block game. Literally, the game is made up of blocks, it is a sandbox game that has infinite terrain generation which allows for the user to explore FOREVER!
There are different elements to Minecraft. You can build, engineer, engage in combat and so much more. Not to mention the endless communities that Minecraft has to offer which
anyone can be a part of. Minecraft is separated into Singleplayer, Multiplayer and Realms which you can find more about with the links above. Minecraft revolves around Health,
Hunger, Experience, Armour(Armor) and Oxygen. Health is health, it is a bar in Minecraft of which you have 10 hearts. You can lose hearts, when you take fall damage, when you
get attacked by a hostile mob, or you have no hunger. Hunger is hunger, it is also a bar in Minecraft which you also have 10 of. You lose hunger by running around, walking and
bascially doing anything, or even nothing as long as the Day and Night Cycle is happening. Experience is a unique feature in Minecraft, you can get experience orbs from mining
ores, smelting items in a furnace and killing mobs. You can use experience to enchant the Player's Items with enchantments that make the tool faster, more durable, mend itself
give more drops from an ore. It can also be applied to armour(armor) to make you take less damage from projectiles, explosions, fall damage and all of the above. There is a lot
more to be said about this unique game, more information can be found on the Singleplayer page.

<h3>
The History of Minecraft
</h3>
<p>
Markus "Notch" Alexej Persson is the founder of the company Mojang. Mojang is the company which created Minecraft. It was sold to Microsoft in 2014, and there is a rift in the 
Minecraft community if it was a good or a bad decision. However, the one thing we can still agree on is that Minecraft is a splendid game regardless of its ownership. Minecraft,
believeit or not, was originally a website game. Minecraft also went through many name changes. It was first called "Cave Game" and then the game was renamed to "Minecraft:
Order of the Stone" and then finally just "Minecraft". Minecraft has been through many stages. It was first released to the public in Alpha and then Beta and then properly
released with version 1.0. Another man responsible for the way this game is now, is Jens "Jeb" Peder Bergensten. Jeb used to be the designer for Minecraft, suggesting and taking
feedback from the Community making the game better and more enjoyable and adding wanted features by the Community
